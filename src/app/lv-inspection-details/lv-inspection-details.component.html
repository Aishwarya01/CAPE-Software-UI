    <h2>Verification of LV Systems (IEC 60364-6)</h2>
    <div id="printdiv">
        <br>
        <p>IEC 60364 gives the rules for the design, erection, and verification of electrical installations up to 1000 V
            AC and 1500 V DC. These rules are adopted/followed worldwide as wiring rules. Some of the adopted national
            versions of this standard are BS7671 in UK, VDE0100 in Germany â€¦ etc. The NFPA 70 (NEC) of USA closely
            follows the fundamental safety measures recommended in IEC 60364.
            In India the standard is adopted as IS732 for general installations and Part 3 of National Building Code of
            India part 3 for special locations.
            The rules are intended to provide for the safety of persons, livestock and property against dangers and
            damage which may arise in the reasonable use of electrical installations and to provide for the proper
            functioning of those installations.
            The rules are applicable in design, erection and verification of electrical installations such as
            residential, commercial, public, industrial, agricultural and horticultural, prefabricated buildings,
            caravans, caravan sites and similar sites, construction sites, exhibitions, fairs and other installations
            for temporary purposes, marinas, external lighting and similar installations, medical locations, mobile or
            transportable units, photovoltaic systems, low-voltage generating sets etc.
            Verification ensures safety of the installation and its conformity to the standard in design, selection and
            erection of the installation. Initial and periodic verifications are necessary.
